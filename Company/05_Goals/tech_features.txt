enhance stereo camera range (idea triggered by martin zeilinger at balocco ws in june 2022):
- trainable far-range matching including rain and fog scenarios (why probably doable: already existing solutions looking thru fog etc. AND solutions estimating depth based and solo monoimages)
- could clearly outperform radar and lidar ranges which suffer from physical damping effects on sensor-target distance
