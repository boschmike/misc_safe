enhance stereo camera range (idea triggered by martin zeilinger at balocco ws in june 2022):
- trainable far-range matching including rain and fog scenarios (why probably doable: already existing solutions looking thru fog etc. AND solutions estimating depth based and solo monoimages)
- could clearly outperform radar and lidar ranges which suffer from physical damping effects on sensor-target distance

online estimate lateral vehicle dynamics parameter (state estimation), majorly for simplified vehicle models (like bicycle models)
- estimate parameters (understeering gradient, roational inertia, steering gain etc.) online
- apply parameters online in steering control (and longitudinal control, if required)
(see MAN T&B, did masters thesis on this topic)

estimate futurous behavior of cut-in vehicle via trainable NNs
- enhance classical prediction based on latest vehicle dynamics data
- prevent from harsh vehicle reactions that are based on short-termed dynamics (e.g. deceleration) peaks
- background: cut-in vehicles usually brake intensively right when entering the rhs lane (in order to get from overtake speed down to common rhs lane speed)
